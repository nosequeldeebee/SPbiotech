This repository holds a Go program using Regular Expressions, that filters through a series of text files collected from S&P capital IQ. The program has two templated files called Allucent and Zymeworks for a public vs. private company data collection and filters through the text files accordingly. If the company's tearsheet file inidicates it is private, it will follow the private path and write to our database accordingly. If the company is public, it will follow the public path and write to the database accordingly. The folder S&P containts each of the company's tearsheet collected. Files with SA in their name are indicated as "Strategic Alliance" files to collect the total number of listed Strategic Alliances that an individual company has. Therefore, if the program finds the name of the file contains SA, it will path to log the details of a Strategic Alliance file and write it to our database.
