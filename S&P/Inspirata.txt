Business Description
Inspirata, Inc. develops solution-as-a-service digital pathology software that automates the entire pathology workflow for patients, pathologists, leadership clients, and IT managers. It offers PathologyNEXT, a technology that improves cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment; and Digital Pathology Cockpit, a multi-screen configuration with digital pathology software that supports viewing and manipulation of images. The company also provides diagnostic aids and decision support tools, such as mitoSEK, a screening tool that identifies all high-likelihood mitotic figures at intermediate and high-power magnifications; and histoSEK, a tool that depicts spatial colocation of tumor foreground and excludes background stroma, which assists the pathologist by identifying all tumor areas. In addition, it offers prognostic and predictive assays that provide prognoses and predict patient responses to therapies; and Cancer Information Data Trust, a database of cancer signatures cross-referenced to clinical treatment protocols and patient outcomes for education, research, and clinical activities. Further, the company provides a natural language programming (NLP) engine for structuring data for reporting or research purposes; a platform for digital pathology image storage and retrieval; enterprise service bus (ESB), a solution that connects institution-maintained integration engines to the existing systems that simplify the complexities of multiple points of contact between systems. Furthermore, it offers hyperconverged technology, a solution within a single EMC Vblock hardware unit that combines an integrated computing, networking, storage, and virtualization into a single pool of resources; and data management and security solutions. Inspirata, Inc. was formerly known as Diagnostic Precision, Inc. and changed its name to Inspirata, Inc. in December 2014. The company was incorporated in 2014 and is based in Tampa, Florida with additional locations in North York, Canada and Berkshire, United Kingdom.
